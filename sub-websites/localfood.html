        <h1>The dishes you can't miss</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Basque cuisine is one of the most famous in the world and many of the finest chefs come from the region. The
            food of Bilbao in particular has a lot of personality and local produce of a high quality. Basque
            restaurants are some of the most renowned and its gastronomy always stands out: its seafood and the unusual
            ways in which it is prepared never fail to win people over.
        </p>
        <p>Pintxos are the most well-known part of Basque food and seeing Bilbao’s characteristic food in miniature is
            really a sight for sore eyes. Cod, hake, elvers, tuna, baby cuttlefish and much more. The key to a good dish
            is the ingredients and Bilbao has the very best. If you’re going on a short break to the capital of Biscay,
            be sure to make a note of everything you need to order to get a taste for the city’s most authentic food.

            <h2>Marmitako</h2>
            <div class="dish-description">
                <p>A traditional stew made from bonito, potatoes and vegetables that is perfect for enjoying in the
                    colder months. There’s nothing better to warm you up than a good marmitako. Its secret? Cooking it
                    slowly over a low heat so that it is extra tasty. Once it’s ready we recommend eating it
                    immediately.</p>

                <p>Cod live in the waters off the Bay of Biscay, which is why it is one of the fundamental ingredients
                    of the region’s food. Many local dishes revolve around cod, but one of the most popular is bacalao a
                    la vizcaína (Biscay-style cod). The dish traditionally used to only consist of a sauce made of
                    pimiento choricero (a type of red pepper), but over time it has evolved to include tomato, which
                    softens the pepper’s intense flavour.</p>
